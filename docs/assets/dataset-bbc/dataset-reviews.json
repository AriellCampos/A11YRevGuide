I use it only for reading books so i cant vouch for other non-recreational aspect of the app. I love the brightness settings because i can make it super dim for late night reading or to reduce eye strain saves me hella moolah cuz now i dont need to buy an $80 kindle to read... another huge plus is that if you hold a word there is a pop up definition.

Or make it an option for people who don't like the current ui. I'm taking off two stars for this. Quick update: Microsoft changed the ui with the latest update and it looks like the pc application and I'm loving it. Thanks Microsoft. Its much better than the previous ui. Also as a suggestion add a dark mode/theme to reduce battery usage eyestrain and an easy way to implement it would be to reverse the blacks and whites. Just a suggestion. Also add a way to set a few default options like page layout font font size etc. And add a recovery/repair option to the app to repair the file in case something goes wrong. Old review for an older version: The app is fine but sometimes the blinker teleports out of its spot and to another line or paragraph entirely. Some words vanish some lines automatically appear. Some words don't delete or delete other words entirely from another line. Sometimes when I paste text it doesn't stay like to should. For example if I paste bold text in a larger font from another part of the document somewhere it appears as plain text. Something italic reverts back to plain text. From the same document. This is really annoying. I have to close and restart the app to fix the problem and this usually isn't that big of a problem for me but when it take over 15-30 seconds to fully load a medium sized file (120 pages) to a large file (200+ pages) it makes me waste a lot of time. As a writer a college going student and other stuff my time is precious. And the thing is since it is a docx file I can't open it in anything other than my phone cause I don't have a laptop or computer anymore. I used to type on my computer but since having accidentally fried it this app has been my sole way of continuing with my work. Please Microsoft fix this.",

The. Theres the actual chat issuse. You can no longer save or share images that are shared even though there are options for it they just never work and i have yet to find a way to change that. Pressing the enter key now just closes out of the key board? Not really sure why you added that? Now theres no way to put partitions in long messages. Also the little smiles dont move in when your picking them out and i perzonally dont have the order memorized making it really hard to tell what your actually choosing. Honestly if any company learned somthing from tge uproar with the release of windows 8 its that shouldnt *completely* change the way somthing is set up or looks all at once. No one wants to completly relearn how to use something. ALSO how do i turn of the vibration on notification?! I cant fund anything anywhere for it??? Really if you put somthing in like that there needs to be a way to turn it off and your 'tutorial' things you needed to clear with the new update dis nothing to help explain the new changes.

    "body": "While the abilities to add an image to a text post or change the font thereof are appreciated there are still a number of functionality and useability issues that have yet to be resolved and/or have arisen with this new mobile update. 1. The search function still turns up no results on my own blogs regardless of whether the search bar's content is correctly typed. This error has been present for at least three updates. 2. Please put the tabs bar back on the top of the screen - or add a function for individual users to choose whether it's on the top or the bottom of the screen. This change implemented in the previous update was not only unnecessary and pointless but also unexpected thereby causing many users (myself included) to experience mental distress. Your userbase is made up of an overwhelmingly large number of people with mental illnesses. These mental illnesses can sometimes be caused to flare when the person is exposed to a sudden and unexpected change. 3. The new blue bubble around tags being typed is distracting at best and a major accessibility issue at worst. For those with vision problems the blue bubble may make it impossible to proofread the text within regardless of the color of said text. 4. The fact that tags being typed may be cut off by an ellipsis makes proofreading difficult even for those with healthy eyesight and even more so for those with memory issues (such as myself and several of my friends who also use this app). 5. The clickable area for adding tags to a post is now smaller. This makes tagging less accessible to those with vision problems and/or poor fine-motor control. The previous interface which provided a long bar as the clickable area was much more accessible. 6. It now takes more steps to create tag and choose the posting time of both new posts and reblogs. The previous interface was much more efficient and user-friendly. 7. While the new ability to read every tag on a post without scrolling is appreciated the 'See All' command often does not show all proceeding tags. It often cuts out proceeding tags that are shorter than three words each. 8. This final note is more of a personal preference but the personal preferences of your userbase are still things you should take into consideration when formulating an update. A return of the full-page list of a user's blogs/sideblogs from which said user could access any of their blogs or blogs' settings they needed to would be highly appreciated.

I was pleasantly surprised actually! It wasn't that bad at all! It's not that much different! I was thinking...what are all these people complaining about this so much for? Because you have to tap on the things now to open them? Big whoop! Everyone is entitled to their own likes and opinions of course and I don't mean any disrespect to anyone here but There's nothing wrong with this app! The old version was great too. It didn't need to be changed but everyone is being a little ridiculous and over dramatic about this one! It's not that hard to navigate through at all in my opinion!

This happens a second time which adds to the frustration. It's kind of like someone slapping a newspaper out of your hand as your reading it. Finally some articles have a video which leads a person to believe the video will be about that particular article. Instead clicking on such videos just starts the live CNN feed so you don't get to watch what you were interested in unless it happens to be playing on the live feed when you click on it.

'How do I buy coins?.... Okay now how do I sell them?' And turns it into something not dissimilar from mobile banking. Some things I would love to see improved on/added are: Dark mode! (Checking the market through this app just after waking up will blind you) Better widgits!!!! (I know not many people use them but I'd love to see how much USD I have in the market at a quick glance. Adjusting background occupancy and text color would be awesome too) More clear deduction of fees. My first time I chucked $30 from my debit card into BTC and I was wondering why only $28.01 went through when there was only a $1 fee listed. (3% fee for non-bank account transactions apparently) + the $1 fee listed for conversion equals my missing $1.99",

With Facebook having a dedicated accessibility team there is no excuse whatsoever for this to be the case especially given the fact that both Facebook and Messenger as well as the Messenger Lite app are TalkBack compatible. So why shouldn't Facebook lite be? When I open the app for the first time I was greeted by an unlabelled image that TalkBack won't read again making it completely unuseable. Great if it uses less data/storage but alas tough luck for TalkBack users. Facebook I'm very disappointed I would have expected better from you guys. Please make this TalkBack friendly!",

It reminds me of an old Google Voice (when it worked).",

It is great that the Swiggy team acknowledged the accessibility issues with the app and then set out to correct the same. That effort is to be greatly appreciated. After the most recent update it is now possible for a TalkBack user to order food on Swiggy. Not like the old way but using the Actions option from the TalkBack menu after focusing on a particular item. The entire menu will still not be available but on doubletapping the 'Recommended Item the next category will become available tapping on that will present the next and so on. Not ideal but functional. The positive approach of the Swiggy team indicates that they will take seriously the issue with the menu option not being TalkBack accessible even now. The menu option at the bottom of the screen is not even recognized by TalkBack. Hope with the next update they will get that sorted. The effort and commitment of the team deserves 5 stars.

Using the movie editor is problematic as well since you are forced to use music but the app is slow also which slows you down as well. The backup and cynce feature is another problem. It is quick to snatch a photo or video that has arived in a folder that you wanted to backup but it doesn't give you a chanve to rename the file and if you did rename the file while in the backup process the original name is kept.",

My home screen and navigation panel widget also developed temporary issues when testing with Talback straight after the update - the home screen app wouldn't open the app or display info about the current song.

I have noticed however that there are a couple of bugs which need to be addressed and squashed. Firstly when reading direct messages (especially longer DM's) TalkBack doesn't read the message in its entirety. Instead it reads a couple of sentences or lines after which it refreshes and reads again from the beginning of said message. In some cases the TalkBack focus moves to an earlier or later message as it is reading a specific one within that specific conversation window. Also in the Home tab TalkBack doesn't focus on the first tweet on my timeline and I have to scroll all the way up until I find it. I'm very disappointed to see that these two issues have not been fixed in the latest update! Please fix!",

In OfficeSuite TalkBack will not read any document of any filetype making it impossible for me to read navigate through or edit documents. Also there are a lot of unlabelled buttons which TalkBack cannot identify thus it is impossible to know what said buttons do. Please make the app more TalkBack compatible and I will adjust my rating accordingly.",

I find the app largely useful however there are a couple of major issues that need to be fixed. First in Delhi at least I have observed that you won't get a cab after 9 30 at night very often. Same is the case during early morning too. Then during day time the peak rate gets far too high so unless there are worthwhile offers I look at other apps Uber has a lot more cabs at night...... The 2nd is an accessibility related issue. I am a blind person using my phone with Google's TalkBack screen reader. The Ola app is largely accessible but the driver rating section is not at all accessible. The different ratings are not read out by TalkBack one has to do a random tap and hope for the best. Hopefully these issues will be fixed pretty soon.",

Sometimes a user can publish .a story but it doesn't actually publish it or it doesn't show everything .the author wrote to the author. (i.e. the author writes some then comes .back and writes more later. The stuff written later won't show to the .author in the published chapter in reader mode but it will show for other .readers.) Also chapters often have ‚Äúrevision issues‚Äù not allowing it to be .published. Sometimes I have this issue 4-5 times to publish a chapter .other times it's not a problem. 3) MESSAGE BOARD- Message board (where one .can pm others) is often down and doesn't send messages through always and .it doesn't always update if new messages are received. 4) POOR CUSTOMER .SERVICE- Wattpad help is where you can message a bot and then message the .support team if there is an issue however the bots are next to useless. .With limited dialogue they can understand they often just pick out words .they know and decide what you clearly should be asking. As for messaging .support It only appears as on the actual site not app and I have tried .this only to find no message actually goes through. Overall I rate 3 stars .only because I loved it so much-it really deserves one or maybe two. It has .become a disappointment. All four of these issues have exist for at least 6 .months and have not been fixed in any updates. I was tempted to upgrade to .Wattpad premium but I'm not willing to pay money for a glitchy app with no .customer service.",
